    ##OOP-Project
    
    The main idea of this project is to implement some basic concepts of inheritance
    in C++ aside the other OOP principles, 
    applying polymorphic dependencies between classes.
    Given a discreption of the system of which a company consists of, 
    the goal was to design and determine dependencies between different classes derive hierarchy of similiar classes.
